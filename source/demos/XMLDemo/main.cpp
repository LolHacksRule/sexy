//	This is the starting point for all new projects. This file's purpose is
//	pretty small, but important. In here we create our application, initialize
//	it, and begin processing all the game code.
//
//	NOTE: You should have read and understood demos 1 and 2 before 
//	this, as topics that are already covered will be either not commented
//	or minimally so. In addition, this demo uses just a couple features from the v.1.2
//	release of the framework, so it is beneficial to have read and understood
//	V12Demo as well. Though, if you fully understand demos 1 and 2, you'll probably
//	be fine enough.
//
//	This demo will teach you:
//	* How to read in XML files from disk
//  * How to sift through the XML data and extract the information you need
