		// and then just draw your image at 0, 0. Think of the Graphics object by
		// default as always being at 0, 0. By translating it, you move that
		// to whereever you like. The usefulness is in saving extra typing,
		// as well as some other features that come into play when scrolling
		// large worlds with many objects. For each of the background layers,
		// let's move the graphics object to its base XY location:
		g->TranslateF(mLayer[i].mX, mLayer[i].mY);

		// Something else to know about translation is that it is the method
		// used when drawing widgets. For every widget, the Graphics object
		// is translated to its own X, Y coordinate. Thus, when drawing
		// in the widget's class, you should always draw as if the top left
		// corner of the widget itself was 0, 0. Since all along we've been making
		// our Board widget the size of the screen, this hasn't been something we've
		// had to care about. But as you'll see in the dialog box example, it's something
		// we have to take into consideration. Normally, you can't draw outside the
		// X, Y, width, height of a widget. However, as you'll also see, you can
		// change that to allow drawing anywhere you want.

		// Remember how in previous demos we mentioned that it's common to use the
		// smoother DrawImageF functions instead of DrawImage if the user has 3D
		// acceleration enabled? Let's do that know. We can check if hardware acceleration
		// is on or not with a call to SexyAppBase's Is3DAccelerated:

			//	g->DrawImageF(mLayer[i].mImage, mLayer[i].mX, mLayer[i].mY);
