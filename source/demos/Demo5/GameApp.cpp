	// a format called MO3, which is a compressed version of a tracker
	// file. For this example, we will use the MO3 from AstroPop.
	// Why? Cause it's ours and we won't get sued for using it.
	// We load our file manually, we do not use the resource manager for this.
	// The first parameter is the ID to associate the song with. Just as sounds

	// Let's load another copy of the file. Why? In order to fade from one

	// channels. Let's load it again and give it a different ID, 1.
	mMusicInterface->LoadMusic(1, "music/music.mo3");

	// Now we need to start playing a track. Because we are using an MO3
	// and because the original format was a .it (Impulse Tracker) file,
	// there are actually multiple songs inside of it, differentiated
	// by various offsets. If you were just playing a single MP3 or OGG
	// or WAV file instead of a tracker file, you would ignore this
	// and use the default offset of 0 for the start of the song.
	// Because the person that made the song file was nice and
	// told us which offsets equated to which song pieces, I already
	// know the magic offset numbers. In this particular case, the
	// song for the intro screen is at offset 0, and the song
	// for the main game music is at offset 9. Our music artist
	// also was kind enough to put in tracker looping commands,
	// so you'll notice that the songs play over and over. A discussion
	// of tracker file formats is beyond the scope of this. Again,
	// if you are just playing a WAV/OGG/MP3, you use offset 0 (the default)
	// to indicate that you want to start playing from the start of the song.
	//
	// You can use PlayMusic to instantly play the track, or, like below,
	// you can use FadeIn to smoothly fade the song in. The first parameter
	// for both methods is the channel or song id that was used when the
	// track was first loaded (In our case, either 0 or 1 works). For both,
	// the second parameter is the offset to start playing at. Again, I just
	// happen to know that the intro song is at offset 0. For FadeIn, the
	// third parameter is how quickly to fade in, out of 1.0. The last parameter
	// for both indicates whether or not you want to loop. This is kind of weird,
	// but specify "false" to loop and "true" to not loop.
	mMusicInterface->FadeIn(0, 0, 0.002, false);

	// Next, we need to know how many resources there are to load.
	// This is necessary so we can display our progress bar on the title screen
	// and make it be the appropriate length. There's a variable in SexyAppBase
	// called mNumLoadingThreadTasks which holds the number of resources to
	// load in the LoadingThreadProc function. You get the number of resources
