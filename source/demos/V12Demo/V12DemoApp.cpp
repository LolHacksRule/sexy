	// This is new. Widgets now contain flags that alter the behavior of them.
	// Please read the document included with the 1.2 release for a full description,
	// but here's the general rundown:
	// The WidgetManager's mDefaultBelowModalFlagsMod contains flags that are applied
	// anytime a dialog box pops up on screen. If we modify these, then we modify the
	// default behavior for ALL dialog boxes, and don't have to mess around with other
	// function calls and setting of misc. variables. All flags variables contain 2
	// sub-variables: mAddFlags and mRemoveFlags. By ORing stuff with mAddFlags, when
	// a dialog box pops up, the flags in mAddFlags are applied in addition to any
	// other flags that exist. Similarly, mRemoveFlags contains flags that are removed
	// from a widget when the dialog pops up. Below, what we're saying is that when
	// a dialog box pops up, we DO NOT want any widgets beneath it to be able to update.
	// What'll happen is that any widget below the dialog gets the WIDGETFLAGS_UPDATE
	// flag removed. This will of course be restored when the dialog box closes.
	// Again, please see the 1.2 doc for a list of all the flags and a much more
	// thorough explanation.
	mWidgetManager->mDefaultBelowModalFlagsMod.mRemoveFlags |= WIDGETFLAGS_UPDATE;
