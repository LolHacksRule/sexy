	// override the AddedToManager and RemovedFromManager functions, create and add your
	// widgets or remove and nuke them, and in the case of AddedToManager, you also had
	// to then place the widget using global coordinates that had no relation to the coordinates
	// you set the parent widget at. Not anymore. What we can do now is to dispense with
	// overriding those methods altogether! So now, in the parent's constructor, we can
	// create our child widgets, resize them, and place them using relative coordinates.
	// What this also means is that moving the parent widget around results in moving
	// ALL the child widgets, which means you no longer have to manually move everything
	// just because the parent moved. In addition, another nice thing is that you no longer
	// have to remove your child widgets before deleting them: this is handled automatically
