	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//	Function: DrawOverlay
	//	Parameters: g - The graphics object to draw with
	//
	//	Purpose: Previously, you had to make a separate OverlayWidget object
	//	if you wanted to do a full screen overlay for say a paused state.
	//	That was annoying, since you had to deal with the messiness of ensuring
	//	that it covered all the appropriate widgets, and had to take care when
	//	removing it. Plus, it was a waste to have to make such a minor object
	//	just to draw a layer above other widgets. Enter the DrawOverlay method:
	//	In your main Draw(...) method, whenever you want the overlay to be drawn,
	//	you just make a call to DeferOverlay. You can pass in a priority that indicates
	//	when the overlay is drawn: the default is 0, but the higher the priority, the
	//	more toplevel (and thus the higher above the other widgets) it will be drawn at.
	//	This can be easily used to draw layers above ALL widgets, or to draw layers above
	//	most widgets but still below some sort of other widget, like an options dialog, etc.
	//	Widgets also have an mPriority variable (defaults to 0), which, setting it higher, will
	//	of course affect at which order in the drawing routine it runs at.
	//
	//	NOTE: This can be used for anything, not just the pause state. You could
	//	easily have an effect that transitions from one level to the next, and
	//	it could be drawn above all the buttons/widgets on screen, rather than
	//	using some sort of overlay widget as well.
