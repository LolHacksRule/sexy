	// Remeber the flag explanation in the 1.2 doc and V12Demo.cpp? Sure you do.
	// This is basically another use of it. All widgets by default have the following
	// flags set:
	//	WIDGETFLAGS_UPDATE		- The widget gets its Update and UpdateF methods called
	//	WIDGETFLAGS_DRAW		- The widget is allowed to draw
	//	WIDGETFLAGS_CLIP		- Set to clip Graphics passed into Draw to the widget's bounds
	//	WIDGETFLAGS_ALLOW_MOUSE	- Set to allow mouse interaction
	//	WIDGETFLAGS_ALLOW_FOCUS	- Set to allow focus to be maintained 
	//
	//	Previously, if you wanted to mark the widget dirty every frame (and thus draw every
	//	frame), you had to call MarkDirty() all the time. Instead of doing that, we can just
	//	use the flag system. By ORing WIDGETFLAGS_MARK_DIRTY with mWidgetFlagsMod.mAddFlags,
	//	when we are added to the widget manager, the manager will then know that we want to
	//	be marked dirty every frame automatically, instead of manually calling MarkDirty().
	//	Yes, I know, that's not a huge deal, but as you can see from the other flags,
	//	it's now easy to set/unset various flags for various widgets and..various reasons.
	//	If you wanted to remove flags set by default for this widget, you'd just OR the
	//	flags to remove with mWidgetFlagsMod.mRemoveFlags. You can affect ALL widgets if you
	//	want to set up widget defaults, by modifying mApp->mWidgetManager's mWidgetFlags
	//	structure in a similar way.

	// override the AddedToManager and RemovedFromManager functions, create and add your
	// widgets or remove and nuke them, and in the case of AddedToManager, you also had
	// to then place the widget using global coordinates that had no relation to the coordinates
	// you set the parent widget at. Not anymore. What we can do now is to dispense with
	// overriding those methods altogether! So now, in the parent's constructor, we can
	// create our child widgets, resize them, and place them using relative coordinates.
	// What this also means is that moving the parent widget around results in moving
	// ALL the child widgets, which means you no longer have to manually move everything
	// just because the parent moved. In addition, another nice thing is that you no longer
	// have to remove your child widgets before deleting them: this is handled automatically

	// MORE NEW STUFF? Yes. Think back to the previous framework version:

	// but you would have a hard time scaling and rotating all at once. You could
	// create images in memory to hold the scaled or rotated versions, but that's annoying.
	// BEHOLD: DrawImageTransform/F. All you have to do is create a Transform object,
	// and apply various transformations to it, then call DrawImageTransform/F.
	// Let's take a look:
	Transform t;

	// Let's rotate the image between 0 and 360 degrees (note that you could also
	// use the radian version of the function). So far, not hard, right?
	t.RotateDeg((float)(mUpdateCnt % 360));
	
	float sw = 1.0f;
	float sh = 1.0f;
	
	// Don't get scared here. This is just a little trickery to expand/contract
	// the image depending on the update count. All it does is expand the image
	// to normal size for a second, and then shrink it to almost invisible for
	// another second, which makes that pulse effect happen.
	int mod = mUpdateCnt % 200;
	if (mod < 100)
	{
		sw = (float)(mod + 1) / 100.0f;
		sh = (float)(mod + 1) / 100.0f;
	}
	else
	{
		mod = 200 - mod;
		sw = (float)mod / 100.0f;
		sh = (float)mod / 100.0f;
	}

	// And now we just tell the transform object, t, that we want to scale. 
	// The value for the x and y direction should be a %, so 1.0 means no change in scale.
	// Let's also mirror and flip the image at the same time too. To mirror and flip, we'll
	// just multiply sw and sh by -1. Of course, it'll be hard to tell that it's flipped and mirrored
	// since it's rotating at the same time, so if you don't believe me you can try commenting
	// out the t.RotateDeg(...) call above and you'll see that it works.
	t.Scale(-sw, -sh);
	
	// And now we just pass in our transform object and it works in both 2D and 3D! Note that we can also
	// draw the image at a given XY as well. We'll make it move rightward depending on the update count.
	// ******************IMPORTANT NOTE:*********************
	// DrawImageTransform/F and DrawImageMatrix use the CENTER of the image rather than the top left
	// for XY drawing. For images of even size, the non-F form of the function will just truncate
	// the the center, but for the F forms, they will be offset by 0.5f since floating point is used.
	if (gSexyAppBase->Is3DAccelerated())

	// You can now draw using matrices. Why the heck would you want to use matrices? Besides doing some
	// crazy stuff, you can also do some cool little tricks. For example, previously it used be a pain
	// to in real-time flip and mirror an image. While I won't give a tutorial on matrix algebra
	// (that would take a loooooong time), I'll explain the essential parts:
	SexyTransform2D matrix;


	// Multiplying the X coordinate by -1 (which is the 0, 0 element of the matrix) will result in our
	// image being mirrored, while multiplying the Y coordinate by -1 (1, 1 in the matrix) will result in our
	// image being flipped.
	matrix.m[0][0] *= -1;
	matrix.m[1][1] *= -1;

	// Let's also shear it. While mirroring/flipping could easily be done with the DrawImageTransform methods,
	// doing more complex matrix manipulation (like shearing) can only be done with the DrawImageMatrix function.
	matrix.m[0][1] = 2;

	// And then we just make a call to DrawImageMatrix and give it our specified XY coordinates as well,
	// and that's it! This works in both 2D and 3D modes.
	g->DrawImageMatrix(IMAGE_HUNGARR_LOGO, matrix, 300, 400);	

	// IMPORTANT COMPARISON NOTE:
	// DrawImageTransform/F will try to use the faster drawing methods if it recognizes certain
	// common transforms, like rotating and scaling. This only works though if you are using
	// either one operation, or multiple operations of the same type (i.e. you only used scale
	// or rotate with the Transform object, or used the same one multiple times). If you mix
	// operations, like we do above, the DrawImageTransform method will actually use DrawImageMatrix.
	// With DrawImageTransform, you can't directly modify the underlying matrix, so if that's something
	// you need to do, then DrawImageMatrix is a better option.

		// obviously the program would be stuck in the loop until it completed, making it look like the
		// whole thing is frozen, and not updating the display. By putting UpdateApp in the while loop,
		// you enable ALL the other widgets to update, and thus draw, which in turn means we can see
		// our little curtain transition effect working as expected. You could even use this method
		// to block while waiting for a dialog/widget to return, but to still allow other widgets
		// to update/draw in the process. ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THOUGH:
		// If you have code like this in your Update methods, be careful, as you can run into some
		// reentrancy problems. If you place this sort of code in your Update methods, make sure you
		// protect it (you could just use a simple bool that's true if doing a transition, otherwise false).
		// Why? Think about it like this: UpdateApp updates ALL widgets, including the one in which the
		// while loop exists. Thus, when going back into Update for said widget, it will once again get
		// stuck in the same while loop, which will effectively prevent any drawing from occurring.

		// button down method.
