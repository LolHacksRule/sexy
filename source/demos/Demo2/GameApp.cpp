// in this tutorial such as font layers, etc.

// The Image.h file just declares basic functions. All images are either of

// A DDImage is actually derived from MemoryImage, so where an Image or
// MemoryImage is required, a DDImage will suffice as well. A DDImage

	// In this case, all of the above extensions will be looked for.
	// A discussion of image formats is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
	//		There is some important information to know about images.
	//	You will notice in the "images" directory that for each image, 
	//	there is a black and white image with the same name but with
	//	an underscore ("_") at the end of it. By default, when you load
	//	and image, the code automatically looks for the presence of
	//	that file to use for the alpha information. Some file formats
	//	have the alpha channel built into them, like PNG files. But
	//	others, like JPEG or GIF files, do not. The purpose of the alpha
	//	file is of course to generate an image that doesn't have jagged
	//	lines, or to control the opacity of various parts of the image.
	//	As a side not, the alpha image file may also begin with the
	//	underscore instead of ending with it, it matters not, and again,
	//	is automatically loaded in by the image loading code.
	//	You need to clean up the memory allocated by these functions yourself.

	// If the file was not found or couldn't be loaded (i.e. due to an
	// incompatible file format) the returned value will be NULL.

	// So we've loaded the images, that's all there is right? Wrong.
	// If possible, we should try to palletize the images. An image that
	// contains 255 or fewer colors can be palletized. This results in
	// a memory savings of about 4x and doesn't affect the image quality
	// at all. It's the same principals that the GIF format uses: instead
	// of representing each red, green, blue, alpha value as a separate
	// quantity (1 byte each, 4 bytes in total per pixel), we represent
	// the actual combined RGBA value as a single number, from 0-255.
	// This number is an index into a lookup table. Thus, every time
	// the value (200,43,11,128), for example, is used, instead of
	// representing that value as a 4 byte value every time it
	// appears, we'd represent it with a 1 byte index into a lookup
	// table that contained the above RGBA value. Don't worry, you
	// don't have to really know or care about any of that if you
	// didn't understand it. What you need to know is that by calling the
	// Palletize() method on an image, you potentially can reduce the
	// amount of RAM it consumes by 4 times. The Palletize method
	// returns a boolean indicating if it could or couldn't be palletized.
	((DDImage*)mOpaqueBeamImg)->Palletize();
	((DDImage*)mMoonImg)->Palletize();
	((DDImage*)mTurbotImg)->Palletize();

	// Now let's load and create some fonts. A font consists of an 
	// image and a text file. The image works on the same principles
	// as a normal image file (like the ones above) works on. Except
	// that with fonts, there is only 1 image, the alpha image.
	// Thus, you will see in the "fonts" directory two images that
	// begin with the underscore prefix. If there isn't a file
	// of the same name without an underscore, then it is assumed that
	// the file is of the same dimensions as the underscore file and that
	// it is to be all white and fully opaque. This is done with fonts because
	// it's common to want to change the color of the font, and to change
	// the color, the base, original image color, should be white and
	// fully opaque. More information on colorizing fonts and images can
	// be found in Board.cpp, but for now know that the image in the fonts
	// directory contains the alpha information for your font, and that it
	// is assumed that the "main" image is pure white.
	//		The other file in the directory is a text file, commonly with the
	//	same name as the image, but without the underscore character, but
	//	not always. The file will define the name of the image to load.
	//	This file defines the characters, their widths, their offsets
	//	within the image, the point size, and any layers (which are not
	//	used or discussed in this demo). This is the data file and is
	//	how the font knows how to take a string and convert it into
	//	the proper images representing each character. A font is really
	//	just an image but with an extra data file that tells the program
	//	how to map strings to their image representation.
	//		You load a font by specifying the text data file.
