	// that it needs to be repainted. All widgets follow this convention.
	//		In general, if you don't need
	// to update your drawing every time you call the Update method
	// (the most common case is when the game is paused) you should
	// NOT mark dirty. Why? If you aren't marking dirty every frame,
	// then you aren't drawing every frame and thus you use less CPU
	// time. Because people like to multitask, or they may be on a laptop
	// with limited battery life, using less CPU time lets people do
	// other things besides play your game. Of course, everyone
	// will want to play your game at all times, but it's good to be
	// nice to those rare people that might want to read email or
	// do other things at the same time. 
	//		In this particular demo, we
	// won't be nice, as the purpose is to bring you up to speed as
	// quickly as possible, and so we'll dispense with optimizations
	// for now, so you can concentrate on other core issues first.
	//		In general, this is the last method called in the Update
	// function, but that is not necessary. In fact, the MarkDirty
	// function can be called anywhere, in any method (although
	// calling it in the Draw method doesn't make sense since it is
	// already drawing) and even multiple times. Calling it multiple
	// times does not do anything: only the first call makes a difference.

void Board::Draw(Graphics* g)
{
	// The Graphics object, "g", is 
	// automatically created and passed to this method by the 
	// WidgetManager and can be thought of as the main screen 
	// bitmap/canvas upon which all drawing will be done. This object
	// is double buffered automatically so you don't need to worry
	// about those details. All you need to do is instruct the object
	// that you would like to draw something to it, and when the
	// WidgetManager gets done letting all widgets draw to the
	// Graphics object, it will then blit everything to the screen
	// at once. 

	// First, let's start by clearing the screen to black. 
	// As you'll recall from Demo1, we set the color with SetColor
	// and pass in a Color object that contains either 3 or 4 parameters,
	// that represent the r,g,b,a values (alpha is 255 if only 3 specified).
	g->SetColor(Color(0, 0, 0));
	g->FillRect(0, 0, mWidth, mHeight);

	// Now let's try drawing a stretched image. We'll draw the original image
	// stretched to twice its size. Drawing a stretched image is exactly like
	// drawing a normal image, except that you have two extra parameters:
	// the stretched width and height. You can use this to draw a shrunk version
	// of the image as well (which we'll do second)	
	g->DrawImage(mApp->mTurbotImg, 0, 0, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetWidth() * 2, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetHeight() * 2);
	g->DrawImage(mApp->mTurbotImg, 0, 275, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetWidth() / 2, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetHeight() / 2);

	// The default stretching algorithm (the one used in the two examples above) uses
	// the slow stretching method. The slow stretching method anti-aliases the resulting
	// image to give a smoother, less pixelated look. While this tends to look a lot
	// nicer, it also requires more processing power. Thus, if you either don't need
	// or don't care about the anti-aliasing, you can instruct the graphics object
	// to use fast stretching. Just remember: unless you turn fast stretching off when
	// done, it will remain on. Let's give it a try by drawing the same image 
	// stretched twice as large using fast stretching.
	g->SetFastStretch(true);
	g->DrawImage(mApp->mTurbotImg, 275, 0, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetWidth() * 2, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetHeight() * 2);
	g->SetFastStretch(false);

	// A good use of fast/non fast stretching is to enable the slower stretching method
	// for users with a supported 3D card and to disable it for users that have
	// to run in software mode. You'll learn more about determining if a user is in
	// 3D mode or not in a later demo, but keep this simple optimization in mind
	// when creating drawing code for your games.

	// Another cool thing we can do is to draw an image mirrored. This is exactly
	// like using the DrawImage command except that you use DrawImageMirror
	// instead. The optional fourth argument is just a convenience switch: if it's false,
	// it will draw the image normally. In 3D mode, this is just as fast as a normal draw.
	g->DrawImageMirror(mApp->mTurbotImg, 75, 275);

	// But what if you want to draw the image mirrored AND stretched? It's a little different,
	// but still easy. The first parameter, like usual, is the image you want to draw.
	// The second parameter is a Rect which indicates the destination region you want to draw
	// the image to: The XY of the Rect is just what you think it is, it's the pixel coordinate
	// the image should be drawn at. The Width, Height of the Rect however is how you accomplish
	// the stretching/shrinking. Specify a different width/height from the original image size
	// and you've just accomplished resizing the original image! Note that we have a third
	// parameter, also a Rect. This is the source rectangle, and indicates the region of
	// image you wish to draw. As you'll see in our animation example, you don't have to
	// always draw the entire image. You can specify a rectangular region of the source image
	// that you wish to draw, which is useful for large strips of animation (more below).
	// For our current case, however, we want to draw the entire image. So we specify that
	// we should draw from the top left (0,0) coordinate of the source image and we should
	// use it's full width/height. Again, just like with DrawImage, you can use the
	// SetFastStretch call to set whether you want the nice, slow, smooth scaling, or the quick
	// and efficient exact scaling. In 3D mode, this is just as fast as a normal stretched draw.
	g->DrawImageMirror(mApp->mTurbotImg, 
						Rect(200, 275, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetWidth() * 2, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetHeight() * 2),
						Rect(0, 0, mApp->mTurbotImg->GetWidth(), mApp->mTurbotImg->GetHeight()));
						

	// Remember that black and white image we made in GameApp::LoadingThreadCompleted?
	// How about we draw it now so you can see what the result looks like:
	g->DrawImage(mApp->mAlteredImg, 500, 0);

	// And now for the exciting part: animation! As you can see in ::Update, we
	// increment the animation frame every 5 update ticks. We don't want to use
	// DrawImage because that will render the entire image. Instead, we only
	// want to draw a particular cel. We do that with the DrawImageCel function,
	// specifying the row or column to draw like so:
	g->DrawImageCel(mApp->mLightningImg, 0, 540, mAnimFrame);

	// If your animation strips contain both multiple rows AND columns,
	// you will need to use one of the alternate forms of DrawImageCel.
	// DrawImageCel is really just a convenience wrapper around DrawImage.
	// As you may have seen, you can tell DrawImage to draw just a particular
	// rectangular region of the image. Here is the equivalent function
	// call that we could have used in place of DrawImageCel above:
	//g->DrawImage(mApp->mLightningImg, 
	//Rect(0, 540, mApp->mLightningImg->GetWidth(), mApp->mLightningImg->GetCelHeight()),
	//Rect(0, mApp->mLightningImg->GetCelHeight() * mAnimFrame, mApp->mLightningImg->GetWidth(), mApp->mLightningImg->GetCelHeight()));
	//
	// As you can see, DrawImageCel is a lot quicker to type. 

	// Let's also display the current mouse XY and which button(s) are held down.
	// You should recall how to set fonts and change their colors from Demo2.
	// You will notice that the X, Y is not updated when the cursor moves over
	// the button that we added. This can be explained by reading the comments
	// for the MouseMove/MouseDrag/MouseDown/MouseUp methods.
	g->SetFont(mApp->mFont);
	g->SetColor(Color(255, 255, 255));
	g->DrawString(StrFormat(_S("X, Y is %d, %d"), mMouseX, mMouseY), 630, 20);
	
	SexyString buttonStr;
	if (mLeftDown)
		buttonStr += _S("Left button is down. ");
	if (mRightDown)
		buttonStr += _S("Right button is down. ");
	if (mMiddleDown)
		buttonStr += _S("Middle button is down. ");

	WriteWordWrapped(g, Rect(630, 40, mWidth - 630, 300), buttonStr, -1, -1);
