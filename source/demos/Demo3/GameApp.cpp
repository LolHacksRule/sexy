	//	have the alpha channel built into them, like PNG files. But
	//	others, like JPEG or GIF files, do not. The purpose of the alpha
	//	file is of course to generate an image that doesn't have jagged
	//	lines, or to control the opacity of various parts of the image.
	//	As a side not, the alpha image file may also begin with the
	//	underscore instead of ending with it, it matters not, and again,
	//	is automatically loaded in by the image loading code.

	// arranged in rows. This is an animation strip and is the main way that we
	// accomplish animation. Rather than putting each frame in a separate file,
	// we place it in one file and make each frame have the same width/height.
	// When loading, the image loader has no idea that we even want to consider
	// the image as being made of multiple frames. So we have to manually tell
	// it how many rows and/or columns it has. In this case, there is only 1

	// So we've loaded the images, that's all there is right? Wrong.
	// If possible, we should try to palletize the images. An image that
	// contains 255 or fewer colors can be palletized. This results in
	// a memory savings of about 4x and doesn't affect the image quality
	// at all. It's the same principals that the GIF format uses: instead
	// of representing each red, green, blue, alpha value as a separate
	// quantity (1 byte each, 4 bytes in total per pixel), we represent
	// the actual combined RGBA value as a single number, from 0-255.
	// This number is an index into a lookup table. Thus, every time
	// the value (200,43,11,128), for example, is used, instead of
	// representing that value as a 4 byte value every time it
	// appears, we'd represent it with a 1 byte index into a lookup
	// table that contained the above RGBA value. Don't worry, you
	// don't have to really know or care about any of that if you
	// didn't understand it. What you need to know is that by calling the
	// Palletize() method on an image, you potentially can reduce the
	// amount of RAM it consumes by 4 times. The Palletize method
	// returns a boolean indicating if it could or couldn't be palletized.

	// By default a widget is invisible because its
	// width/height are 0, 0. Since the Board class is our main
	// drawing area and game logic class, we want to make it the
	// same size as the application. For this particular demo, that means
	// 800x600. We will use mWidth and mHeight though, as those were
	// already set to the proper resolution in GameApp::Init().
	mBoard->Resize(0, 0, mWidth, mHeight);

	// Also an important step is to add the newly created Board widget to

	// and input processing methods called.
	mWidgetManager->AddWidget(mBoard);


	// As part of a new topic in this demo, we're also going to modify the image
	// data for mTurbotImg and make a grayscale version of it. I'll explain
	// each step of the way:

	// 1. Let's make a copy of the image so we don't ruin the original.
	// We should make sure to delete this when we're done.
	mAlteredImg = (DDImage*) CopyImage(mTurbotImg);

	// 2. Now we need to get the pixel data. The pixel data is stored as
	// an unsigned long array, where each entry represents the RGBA value.
	// The data is actually stored in ARGB format, where alpha is
	// the leftmost byte and blue is the rightmost byte.
	unsigned long* bits = mAlteredImg->GetBits();

	// 3. Now we will loop over each pixel in the image. The size of the bits array
	// is simply the width times the height.
	for (int i = 0; i < mAlteredImg->GetWidth() * mAlteredImg->GetHeight(); i++)
	{
		// 4. Get the ARGB color value for this pixel
		unsigned long c = bits[i];

		// 5. To illustrate the ARGB storage format, we will assign each
		// component to a variable, although we're actually only going to care
		// about the RGB values, for this particular example. The 4 lines below
		// extract out the individual ARGB values.
		unsigned char alpha		= (unsigned char) (c >> 24);
		unsigned char red		= (unsigned char) ((c >> 16) & 0xFF);
		unsigned char green		= (unsigned char) ((c >> 8) & 0xFF);
		unsigned char blue		= (unsigned char) (c & 0xFF);

		// 6. Just like the Color class, the ARGB values are from 0-255.
		// Let's alter these to produce a grayscale image using one of many
		// conversion methods. This method uses 30% of the red value,
		// 59% of the green value, and 11% of the blue value:
		unsigned long gray = (unsigned long) ((float)red * 0.30f + (float)green * 0.59f + (float)blue * 0.11f);

		// 7. Now we need to put the pixel data back into the image's data.
		// We do the opposite of how we extracted the ARGB values above and
		// use a left shift instead of a right shift:

		//		      alpha          red           green       blue
		bits[i] = (alpha << 24) | (gray << 16) | (gray << 8) | gray;
	}

	// The image won't use this modified data until we inform it that we've 
	// done some messing around with it. We do that with the BitsChanged()
	// function call. After that, we're all done! Pretty simple. It just
	// depends on what you want to actually do with the RGBA data. Extracting
	// the information and putting it back is as simple as a few shifts.
	mAlteredImg->BitsChanged();
