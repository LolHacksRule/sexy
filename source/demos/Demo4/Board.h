//						Board.h
//
//	This is the third class to look at in this particular demo
//	(after main.cpp and GameApp.h/.cpp). The Board class is where most of
//	your actual game programming will go. It is here that we will do
//	all our game drawing, updating, and input processing. Of course, in
//	a larger application, you would probably do drawing and updating in
//	multiple files, but you would still most likely use something similar
//	to a Board class as the master game logic class. 
//
//	The reason that the Board class is a widget is because when a widget
//	is added to the GameApp's WidgetManager, it will automatically have its
//	Update and Draw methods called, and it will automatically receive input
//	at the appropriate times. Furthermore, by making it a widget and adding
//	it to the WidgetManager, the game logic loop, Update(), will be guaranteed
//	to run at a standard 100FPS on all machines. This is extremely important
//	as you always want your logic code to run at the same speed, but want
//	the drawing code to run as fast as possible. That way on faster machines
//	your program doesn't run its logic faster than on a slower machine.
//
//	You can think of the Board as a canvas upon which we do all our
//	drawing, and a central hub where if we need to, we instruct other
//	classes where and when to draw to.

		//
		//	Purpose: Whenever a checkbox widget is checked or unchecked, this

		//	Parameters:
		//		theId	- Integer ID of the listbox widget sending this message
		//		theIdx	- Integer indicating the index of the item selected in the list

		//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
		//	Function: Update
		//	Parameters: none
		//	Returns: none
		//
		//	Purpose: Called automatically by GameApp's WidgetManager, this method
		//	is GUARANTEED to be called 100 times per second (100FPS) and is where
		//	all main game logic is performed. Of course, if you had a larger more
		//	complex game, you'd most likely divide your logic between several
		//	other files, but this is commonly the central place where all game
		//	logic begins and is executed.
		//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
		virtual void Update();

		//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
		//	Function: UpdateF
		//	Parameters: 
		//		theFrac	- The number of updates this time slice represents.
		//
		//	Returns: none
		//
		//	Purpose:
		//	There has been a fundamental temporal aliasing issue in the previous
		//	demos because games run at a 100 Hz Update rate while the user's monitor 
		//	is refreshing at some other rate, generally between 60 and 85 Hz.  The fixed 
		//	100 Hz Update rate is convenient because it allows game logic to proceed 
		//	independantly from the refresh rate, but in some cases it's worth the extra 
		//	trouble of updating at a variable rate in order to provide smoother animation, 
		//	as in the case of a scrolling background, a shark with words written on it, 
		//	or an Arkanoid ball.
		//
		//	To illustrate the aliasing problem, imagine a ball that is supposed to move 
		//	200 pixels per second, running on a 75 Hz monitor.  The update rate of the 
		//	game is 100 Hz, so that means that we will add 2 pixels to the ball position 
		//	every update, and there will be 1.33 updates per monitor refresh (on average).  
		//	That means that that 2 out of every 3 monitor refreshes will show the ball 
		//	moving 2 pixels, and and the third will show it moving 4 pixels.  That isn't 
		//	smooth motion.  The correct solution would be for the ball to move 2.67 
		//	pixels every monitor refresh.  But how do we do that?
		//
		//	To support smooth motion, we use UpdateF.  Widget::UpdateF is similar to 
		//	Widget::Update, but Widget::UpdateF gets a float passed into it that 
		//	represents how many Update's this time slice represents.  In the 75 Hz 
		//	example, UpdateF would always be called with 1.33.  Update has certainly 
		//	not been made obsolete, however, and you can choose which 
		//	parts of your game logic should be in Update and which should be in 
		//	UpdateF.  To facilitate cooperation and good behavior between the two 
		//	update methods, there are some rules they follow:  Updating always occurs 
		//	in blocks, with one or two Update calls followed immediately with an 
		//	UpdateF call.  This means that the application will never get the chance 
		//	to draw or process input between an Update and a Draw without calling 
		//	UpdateF in the middle.  Therefore, you can assume that focus won't be 
		//	lost, nor will input change between an Update and an UpdateF, and you'll 
		//	know that you'll have a chance to finalize your state in UpdateF so things 
		//	can be left dangling (whatever that means for your app) after Update.  
		//	You are also guaranteed that the value passed in to UpdateF will be between 
		//	1.67 (for a 60 Hz monitor) and 1.0 (for a 100 Hz monitor).  Even if the 
		//	monitor is 60 Hz but the computer is only fast enough to draw at 30 FPS 
		//	you will get two Update blocks in a row before the draw, so it will still 
		//	appear to your app as if you are updating at 60 Hz.
		//
		//		IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
		//
		//	In order to fully use this, you need to set up a few things.
		//	Set GameApp::mVSyncUpdates to true, override UpdateF(float theFrac),
		//	and move some code from Update that used to look like 
		//	this: "mPos += 1.5;", changing it to "mPos += 1.5 * theFrac;".
		//	Check out the C++ code for an example of motion using both Update and
		//	UpdateF.
		//
		//		IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
		//
		//	Because UpdateF is called a variable number of times per second,
		//	you do NOT want to put game logic in it that needs to remain framerate
		//	independant. Use UpdateF ONLY for movement related operations, and not
		//	for your main game code.
		//
		//	If you really want to avoid shearing in windowed mode, you can
		//	set GameApp::mWaitForVSync to true and set GameApp::mSoftVSyncWait
		//	to false. NOTE: This winds up doing some busy waiting and consumes
		//	more processor time. 
		//	IMPORTANT: YOU MUST ALSO DELETE THE FOLLOWING REGISTRY KEY:
		//	Whereever your registry settings are stored 
		//	(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SexyAppFramework\Demo4 for this case),
		//	you must delete the key "WaitForVSync". This is VERY important, and it
		//	won't work otherwise.

		//	Function: ButtonDepress
		//	Parameters:
		//		theId	- Integer ID of the button that was clicked
		//
		//	Returns: none
		//
		//	Purpose: This method is called by the WidgetManager when a button widget
		//	is first pressed and THEN released. You can use ButtonPress if you want
		//	to know when the button is first pressed (before it is released).
		//	theId is the integer ID that was assigned to the button when it was

		//	Purpose: This function is automatically called by the widget manager
		//	which also passes a pointer to itself, when the Board class is
		//	removed from its list of widgets. Every widget gets this function
